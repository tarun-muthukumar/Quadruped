# Quadruped
A four-legged robot with an attached robotic arm Optimized for Autonomous,
rugged terrain navigation and complex environmental sensing for transport of small scale equipment to support military operations.

This Repo contains all the Kinematic solutions and the CAD model of the bot, along with the C++ code for programming the Microcontroller.

# Problem statement 
The goal is to design a bio-inspired quadruped transport solution for defense operations that can navigate difficult terrain while efficiently delivering supplies. 
The solution combines structural and automated features, such as a robotic arm for cargo handling and a 
stabilization system to maintain balance during movement.

# Key challenges
Key challenges include ensuring adaptability across rugged terrains, optimizing weight capacity and speed, maintaining stability, and designing for cost-effective materials and energy efficiency
